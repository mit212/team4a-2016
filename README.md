# 2.12 Team 4A Fall 2016


This is our code that autonomously controls the 2.12 robot to find, capture, and release pokemon around the field.


The main logic is in the catkin_ws/src/state_machine directory. Other directories contain relevant code for running parts of the robot that aren't directly related to completing the high-level tasks. The Procman Sheriff tool was used to run the ros nodes, with the script containing that data under the software/config directory.


All this code is from the Fall 2016 semester of MIT's class 2.12: Introduction to Robotics.
